This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

I started off by creating a separate Express JS backend to serve the api end point but then took the opportunity to explore and leverage Next JS framework as it seem to be a good

all round framework that would fit the purpose. 

It contains both the backend endpoint (/api/events) and the frontend application which contains the positions summary view and a form to add new event.

## Getting Started

After installing dependencies, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and it should load as below with empty positions table.
